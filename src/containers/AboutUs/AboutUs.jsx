          Like many design teams, Onfido made the transition from Abstract +
          Sketch, to Figma in the last couple of years. One of the common
          resistance points internally before making that switch,
          was Figma’s lack of Git-style branching
          that Abstract enabled. The design team had come
          to rely on branching and had built a lot of our processes around it.
